# Getting Started with Create React App

I've used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for setting up the boiler blate for the application as it is an easy and fastest way to setup the react application. And it also came with couple of functionality out of the box which I found useful for faster developement, like HMR and live reload and linting and testing library.

## Node Version:

v16.14.2

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Notes

I've also implemented a Reducer version of the component `LiveSearchWithReducer` using `useReducer` hook to simplify multiple states in a component.
